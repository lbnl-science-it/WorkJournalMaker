## Detailed Implementation Steps

---

## Step 1: Extend Configuration System

**Objective**: Add Google GenAI and LLM provider configuration classes to the existing configuration system.

**Files Modified**: `config_manager.py`

**Testing Strategy**: Unit tests for configuration loading and validation

### Prompt 1.1: Add Google GenAI Configuration Classes

```
I need to extend the configuration system in config_manager.py to support Google GenAI. 

Current context:
- The file already has BedrockConfig, ProcessingConfig, and AppConfig classes
- I need to add GoogleGenAIConfig and LLMConfig classes
- The AppConfig class needs to be updated to include these new configurations

Requirements:
1. Add a GoogleGenAIConfig dataclass with fields:
   - project: str = "geminijournal-463220"
   - location: str = "us-central1" 
   - model: str = "gemini-2.0-flash-001"

2. Add an LLMConfig dataclass with field:
   - provider: str = "bedrock"  # Options: "bedrock" or "google_genai"

3. Update the AppConfig dataclass to include:
   - google_genai: GoogleGenAIConfig = field(default_factory=GoogleGenAIConfig)
   - llm: LLMConfig = field(default_factory=LLMConfig)

4. Update the ConfigManager class to handle loading and validation of these new config sections

5. Add validation logic to ensure the provider value is valid

Please implement these changes while maintaining backward compatibility. The default provider should remain "bedrock" to preserve existing behavior.
```

### Prompt 1.2: Create Configuration Tests

```
I need comprehensive unit tests for the new configuration classes added in the previous step.

Requirements:
1. Create test_google_genai_config.py in the tests/ directory
2. Test GoogleGenAIConfig default values and custom initialization
3. Test LLMConfig default values and validation
4. Test AppConfig integration with new configuration classes
5. Test ConfigManager loading of YAML/JSON files with new configuration sections
6. Test validation of invalid provider values
7. Test backward compatibility - ensure existing configs still work

The tests should follow the existing testing patterns in the project and use pytest. Include both positive and negative test cases.
```

---

## Step 2: Add Google GenAI Dependency

**Objective**: Add the Google GenAI dependency to requirements.txt and verify it can be imported.

**Files Modified**: `requirements.txt`

### Prompt 2.1: Update Dependencies

```
I need to add the Google GenAI dependency to the project requirements.

Requirements:
1. Add "google-genai" to requirements.txt
2. Create a simple test script to verify the import works correctly
3. The test should import the google.genai module and verify basic functionality
4. Handle any potential import errors gracefully

Please update requirements.txt and create a simple verification script that can be run to ensure the dependency is properly installed.
```

---

## Step 3: Create Shared Data Structures

**Objective**: Extract and create shared data structures that both Bedrock and Google GenAI clients will use.

**Files Created**: `llm_data_structures.py`

### Prompt 3.1: Extract Shared Data Structures

```
I need to create shared data structures that will be used by both BedrockClient and the new GoogleGenAIClient.

Current context:
- BedrockClient defines AnalysisResult and APIStats dataclasses
- These need to be shared between multiple LLM clients
- The data structures should be provider-agnostic

Requirements:
1. Create a new file llm_data_structures.py
2. Move AnalysisResult and APIStats from bedrock_client.py to this new file
3. Update bedrock_client.py to import these structures from the new file
4. Ensure all existing functionality continues to work
5. Add comprehensive docstrings to explain the data structures

The AnalysisResult should contain:
- file_path: Path
- projects: List[str]
- participants: List[str] 
- tasks: List[str]
- themes: List[str]
- api_call_time: float
- confidence_score: Optional[float]
- raw_response: Optional[str]

The APIStats should contain:
- total_calls: int
- successful_calls: int
- failed_calls: int
- total_time: float
- average_response_time: float
- rate_limit_hits: int
```

### Prompt 3.2: Update Bedrock Client Imports

```
Now that the shared data structures have been extracted to llm_data_structures.py, I need to update bedrock_client.py to use the shared structures.

Requirements:
1. Remove the AnalysisResult and APIStats dataclass definitions from bedrock_client.py
2. Add import statement: from llm_data_structures import AnalysisResult, APIStats
3. Ensure all existing functionality in BedrockClient continues to work unchanged
4. Update any type hints or references to use the imported structures
5. Run existing tests to verify nothing is broken

This should be a pure refactoring with no functional changes.
```

---

## Step 4: Create Basic Google GenAI Client Structure

**Objective**: Create the basic structure of the GoogleGenAIClient class with minimal functionality.

**Files Created**: `google_genai_client.py`

### Prompt 4.1: Create Google GenAI Client Foundation

```
I need to create the foundation for a GoogleGenAIClient that mirrors the BedrockClient interface.

Current context:
- BedrockClient has methods: __init__, analyze_content, get_stats, reset_stats, test_connection
- The new client should have the same interface but use Google GenAI instead of AWS Bedrock
- Use the GoogleGenAIConfig from config_manager.py
- Import shared data structures from llm_data_structures.py

Requirements:
1. Create google_genai_client.py
2. Import necessary dependencies including google.genai
3. Create GoogleGenAIClient class with:
   - __init__(self, config: GoogleGenAIConfig)
   - analyze_content(self, content: str, file_path: Path) -> AnalysisResult (stub for now)
   - get_stats(self) -> APIStats
   - reset_stats(self) -> None
   - test_connection(self) -> bool (stub for now)

4. Initialize the Google GenAI client in __init__ using:
   - genai.Client(vertexai=True, project=config.project, location=config.location)

5. Set up basic logging and statistics tracking similar to BedrockClient

6. For now, make analyze_content return an empty AnalysisResult and test_connection return False
   - We'll implement the actual functionality in the next steps

Focus on getting the basic structure right and ensuring it can be imported without errors.
```

### Prompt 4.2: Add Basic Google GenAI Client Tests

```
I need unit tests for the basic GoogleGenAIClient structure created in the previous step.

Requirements:
1. Create test_google_genai_client.py in the tests/ directory
2. Test client initialization with valid GoogleGenAIConfig
3. Test that get_stats() returns proper APIStats structure
4. Test that reset_stats() works correctly
5. Test error handling for invalid configuration
6. Mock the google.genai.Client to avoid actual API calls during testing
7. Test that the client can be instantiated without making real API calls

Use pytest and follow the existing testing patterns in the project. Focus on testing the structure and basic functionality, not the actual API integration yet.
```

---

## Step 5: Implement Google GenAI Content Analysis

**Objective**: Implement the core content analysis functionality using Google GenAI API.

**Files Modified**: `google_genai_client.py`

### Prompt 5.1: Implement Content Analysis Method

```
I need to implement the analyze_content method in GoogleGenAIClient to actually call the Google GenAI API and extract entities.

Current context:
- BedrockClient uses a specific analysis prompt to extract projects, participants, tasks, and themes
- The response should be parsed as JSON with the same structure
- Google GenAI API uses client.models.generate_content() method

Requirements:
1. Create an analysis prompt similar to BedrockClient's ANALYSIS_PROMPT
2. Implement _create_analysis_prompt(self, content: str) -> str method
3. Implement _make_api_call(self, prompt: str) -> str method that:
   - Uses self.client.models.generate_content()
   - Uses the configured model from self.config.model
   - Handles basic error cases
   - Updates statistics (total_calls, successful_calls, failed_calls, total_time)

4. Implement _parse_response(self, response_text: str) -> Dict[str, List[str]] method that:
   - Parses JSON from the response
   - Handles cases where JSON might be wrapped in markdown code blocks
   - Returns the expected structure with projects, participants, tasks, themes

5. Update analyze_content to:
   - Call _create_analysis_prompt
   - Call _make_api_call  
   - Call _parse_response
   - Return properly formatted AnalysisResult

6. Add proper error handling and logging throughout

Use the same analysis prompt structure as BedrockClient to ensure consistent results between providers.
```

### Prompt 5.2: Add Content Analysis Tests

```
I need comprehensive tests for the Google GenAI content analysis functionality.

Requirements:
1. Add tests to test_google_genai_client.py for the new analyze_content functionality
2. Mock the Google GenAI API calls to avoid real API usage during testing
3. Test successful content analysis with valid JSON response
4. Test handling of malformed JSON responses
5. Test handling of API errors and exceptions
6. Test statistics tracking (calls, timing, success/failure rates)
7. Test content truncation for very long inputs
8. Test the analysis prompt generation

Create comprehensive test cases that cover both happy path and error scenarios. Use fixtures for common test data and mock responses.
```

---

## Step 6: Add Error Handling and Retry Logic

**Objective**: Add robust error handling and retry logic to the Google GenAI client.

**Files Modified**: `google_genai_client.py`

### Prompt 6.1: Implement Retry Logic and Error Handling

```
I need to add robust error handling and retry logic to the GoogleGenAIClient, similar to what exists in BedrockClient.

Current context:
- BedrockClient has retry logic with exponential backoff
- It handles rate limiting, network errors, and API errors differently
- Statistics are tracked for rate limit hits

Requirements:
1. Update _make_api_call to _make_api_call_with_retry with parameters:
   - max_retries: int = 3
   - Add exponential backoff for retries

2. Handle different types of Google GenAI API errors:
   - Rate limiting errors (should retry with backoff)
   - Authentication errors (should not retry)
   - Network errors (should retry)
   - Invalid request errors (should not retry)

3. Update statistics tracking to include:
   - rate_limit_hits counter
   - proper timing even for failed requests

4. Add comprehensive logging for different error scenarios

5. Ensure that analyze_content gracefully handles all error cases and returns:
   - Empty AnalysisResult on failure
   - Proper error information in raw_response field

6. Add timeout handling for long-running requests

Follow the same error handling patterns as BedrockClient to maintain consistency.
```

### Prompt 6.2: Add Error Handling Tests

```
I need comprehensive tests for the error handling and retry logic in GoogleGenAIClient.

Requirements:
1. Add tests for retry logic with different types of failures
2. Test exponential backoff timing
3. Test rate limiting scenarios and statistics tracking
4. Test authentication error handling (no retry)
5. Test network error handling (with retry)
6. Test timeout scenarios
7. Test that failed requests still update statistics correctly
8. Test graceful degradation when all retries are exhausted

Use mocking to simulate different error conditions and verify that the client behaves correctly in each scenario.
```

---

## Step 7: Implement Connection Testing

**Objective**: Implement the test_connection method for Google GenAI client.

**Files Modified**: `google_genai_client.py`

### Prompt 7.1: Implement Connection Testing

```
I need to implement the test_connection method in GoogleGenAIClient to verify that the client can successfully connect to Google GenAI.

Requirements:
1. Implement test_connection(self) -> bool method that:
   - Makes a simple test API call to verify connectivity
   - Uses a minimal prompt to avoid unnecessary token usage
   - Returns True if connection is successful, False otherwise
   - Does not throw exceptions (catches and logs them instead)
   - Updates statistics appropriately

2. The test should:
   - Use a simple prompt like "Test connection"
   - Verify that a response is received
   - Not require specific response content (just that it responds)

3. Add proper logging for connection test results

4. Ensure the method is safe to call during dry-run mode

This method will be used by the main application to verify configuration during startup.
```

### Prompt 7.2: Add Connection Testing Tests

```
I need tests for the test_connection method in GoogleGenAIClient.

Requirements:
1. Test successful connection scenarios
2. Test connection failure scenarios (network issues, auth issues, etc.)
3. Test that the method doesn't throw exceptions
4. Test that statistics are updated correctly during connection tests
5. Test that the method works with mocked API responses

Ensure the tests cover both positive and negative scenarios and verify that the method behaves correctly in all cases.
```

---

## Step 8: Create Unified Client Interface

**Objective**: Create the UnifiedLLMClient that can switch between providers.

**Files Created**: `unified_llm_client.py`

### Prompt 8.1: Create Unified Client

```
I need to create a UnifiedLLMClient that can switch between BedrockClient and GoogleGenAIClient based on configuration.

Current context:
- Both clients have the same interface: analyze_content, get_stats, reset_stats, test_connection
- The provider is specified in config.llm.provider
- The unified client should delegate all calls to the appropriate underlying client

Requirements:
1. Create unified_llm_client.py
2. Import necessary dependencies including both client classes and AppConfig
3. Create UnifiedLLMClient class with:
   - __init__(self, config: AppConfig)
   - analyze_content(self, content: str, file_path: Path) -> AnalysisResult
   - get_stats(self) -> APIStats
   - reset_stats(self) -> None
   - test_connection(self) -> bool

4. Implement _create_client(self) method that:
   - Checks config.llm.provider value
   - Creates BedrockClient(config.bedrock) if provider is "bedrock"
   - Creates GoogleGenAIClient(config.google_genai) if provider is "google_genai"
   - Raises ValueError for unknown providers

5. All public methods should delegate to the underlying client

6. Add proper error handling for client creation failures

7. Add logging to indicate which provider is being used

The unified client should be completely transparent - callers shouldn't know which underlying provider is being used.
```

### Prompt 8.2: Add Unified Client Tests

```
I need comprehensive tests for the UnifiedLLMClient.

Requirements:
1. Create test_unified_llm_client.py
2. Test client creation with "bedrock" provider
3. Test client creation with "google_genai" provider
4. Test error handling for invalid provider values
5. Test that all methods properly delegate to the underlying client
6. Test provider switching by changing configuration
7. Mock both underlying clients to avoid real API calls
8. Test error propagation from underlying clients

Use fixtures to create different configuration scenarios and verify that the unified client behaves correctly with each provider.
```

---

## Step 9: Add Provider Information Methods

**Objective**: Add methods to identify the current provider and get provider-specific information.

**Files Modified**: `unified_llm_client.py`

### Prompt 9.1: Add Provider Information Methods

```
I need to add methods to the UnifiedLLMClient to provide information about the current provider.

Requirements:
1. Add get_provider_name(self) -> str method that returns the current provider name
2. Add get_provider_info(self) -> Dict[str, Any] method that returns provider-specific information:
   - For bedrock: region, model_id
   - For google_genai: project, location, model

3. Update the class to store the provider name for easy access

4. Add these methods to both underlying clients as well:
   - BedrockClient.get_provider_info() should return bedrock-specific info
   - GoogleGenAIClient.get_provider_info() should return google_genai-specific info

This information will be used by the main application to display configuration details during dry-run mode.
```

### Prompt 9.2: Add Provider Information Tests

```
I need tests for the new provider information methods.

Requirements:
1. Test get_provider_name() returns correct provider for both bedrock and google_genai
2. Test get_provider_info() returns correct information structure for both providers
3. Test that the information matches the configuration used to create the client
4. Add tests to both client test files for their respective get_provider_info() methods

Verify that the returned information is accurate and useful for debugging and configuration display.
```

---

## Step 10: Update Main Application Imports

**Objective**: Update the main application to use the unified client instead of BedrockClient directly.

**Files Modified**: `work_journal_summarizer.py`

### Prompt 10.1: Update Main Application Imports

```
I need to update work_journal_summarizer.py to use the new UnifiedLLMClient instead of BedrockClient directly.

Current context:
- Line 29 imports BedrockClient, AnalysisResult, APIStats from bedrock_client
- Line 572 creates BedrockClient(config.bedrock)
- The rest of the code uses the client through the same interface

Requirements:
1. Update the import on line 29:
   - Change from: from bedrock_client import BedrockClient, AnalysisResult, APIStats
   - To: from unified_llm_client import UnifiedLLMClient
   - Add: from llm_data_structures import AnalysisResult, APIStats

2. Update line 572 (client initialization):
   - Change from: llm_client = BedrockClient(config.bedrock)
   - To: llm_client = UnifiedLLMClient(config)

3. Ensure all other usage of the client remains unchanged (the interface is the same)

4. Test that the application still works with the default "bedrock" provider

This should be a minimal change that maintains all existing functionality while enabling the new unified client architecture.
```

### Prompt 10.2: Test Main Application Integration

```
I need to test that the main application integration works correctly with the unified client.

Requirements:
1. Create integration tests that verify:
   - Application starts correctly with bedrock provider
   - Application starts correctly with google_genai provider
   - Error handling when invalid provider is specified
   - All existing functionality continues to work

2. Test both dry-run and normal execution modes

3. Mock the actual LLM API calls to avoid real API usage during testing

4. Verify that the application produces the same results regardless of which provider is used (when mocked appropriately)

Create comprehensive integration tests that ensure the refactoring doesn't break existing functionality.
```

---

## Step 11: Update Dry-Run Functionality

**Objective**: Update the dry-run mode to display provider-specific information and test connections for the configured provider.

**Files Modified**: `work_journal_summarizer.py`

### Prompt 11.1: Update Dry-Run Provider Display

```
I need to update the _perform_dry_run function in work_journal_summarizer.py to display information about the configured LLM provider.

Current context:
- Lines 322-324 display AWS region and model ID
- The dry-run should now display information for whichever provider is configured
- Should use the new get_provider_info() method from UnifiedLLMClient

Requirements:
1. Update the dry-run function around lines 322-324 to:
   - Display the current LLM provider name
   - Display provider-specific configuration information
   - Use the UnifiedLLMClient's get_provider_info() method

2. The display should show:
   - For bedrock: AWS Region, Model ID
   - For google_genai: GCP Project, Location, Model

3. Update the connection testing logic (around lines 298-312) to:
   - Use UnifiedLLMClient instead of BedrockClient directly
   - Test connection using the configured provider
   - Display appropriate success/failure messages

4. Maintain the same user experience and information display format

The dry-run should provide clear information about which provider is configured and whether it's working correctly.
```

### Prompt 11.2: Test Updated Dry-Run Functionality

```
I need tests for the updated dry-run functionality.

Requirements:
1. Test dry-run with bedrock provider configuration
2. Test dry-run with google_genai provider configuration
3. Test that provider information is displayed correctly
4. Test connection testing with both providers
5. Test error scenarios (invalid provider, connection failures)
6. Mock the LLM clients to avoid real API calls during testing

Verify that the dry-run provides useful information for both providers and handles errors gracefully.
```

---

## Step 12: Update Configuration Example

**Objective**: Update the configuration example file to include the new LLM provider options.

**Files Modified**: `config.yaml.example`

### Prompt 12.1: Update Configuration Example

```
I need to update config.yaml.example to include examples of the new LLM provider configuration options.

Requirements:
1. Add a new section for LLM provider configuration showing:
   - How to specify the provider (bedrock or google_genai)
   - Example configurations for both providers

2. Add Google GenAI configuration section with:
   - project: "geminijournal-463220"
   - location: "us-central1"
   - model: "gemini-2.0-flash-001"

3. Update comments to explain:
   - What each provider option does
   - How to switch between providers
   - Any prerequisites for each provider

4. Maintain the existing bedrock configuration as the default

5. Add clear documentation about which provider is recommended for different use cases

The example should make it easy for users to understand how to configure and switch between providers.
```

---

## Step 13: Create Comprehensive Integration Tests

**Objective**: Create end-to-end integration tests that verify the entire system works with both providers.

**Files Created**: `tests/test_integration_llm_providers.py`

### Prompt 13.1: Create Integration Tests

```
I need comprehensive integration tests that verify the entire LLM provider system works end-to-end.

1. Create test_integration_llm_providers.py
2. Test complete workflow with bedrock provider:
   - Configuration loading
   - Client creation
   - Content analysis
   - Statistics tracking
   - Error handling

3. Test complete workflow with google_genai provider:
   - Same test scenarios as bedrock
   - Verify equivalent results (when mocked)

4. Test provider switching:
   - Change configuration and verify new provider is used
   - Verify clean transition between providers

5. Test error scenarios:
   - Invalid provider configuration
   - API failures with both providers
   - Configuration validation errors

6. Mock all external API calls to avoid dependencies on actual services

7. Use realistic test data that exercises the full analysis pipeline

These tests should give confidence that the entire system works correctly with both providers.
```

### Prompt 13.2: Create Performance Comparison Tests

```
I need tests that compare the performance and behavior of both providers to ensure they're equivalent.

Requirements:
1. Create tests that verify both providers return similar results for the same input
2. Test that both providers handle edge cases similarly:
   - Very long content
   - Empty content
   - Malformed content
   - Special characters

3. Test that error handling is consistent between providers

4. Test that statistics tracking works similarly for both providers

5. Use parameterized tests to run the same test scenarios against both providers

These tests should ensure that users get a consistent experience regardless of which provider they choose.
```

---

## Step 14: Final Validation and Testing

**Objective**: Perform final validation that everything works correctly and no functionality has been broken.

### Prompt 14.1: Create Final Validation Script

```
I need a comprehensive validation script that tests the entire system with both providers.

Requirements:
1. Create validate_llm_providers.py script that:
   - Tests configuration loading for both providers
   - Tests client creation and basic functionality
   - Tests the unified client with provider switching
   - Tests the main application with both providers (using mocks)
   - Validates that all tests pass
   - Checks that no existing functionality is broken

2. The script should:
   - Run all relevant tests
   - Provide clear pass/fail status
   - Give detailed error information for any failures
   - Validate that the system is ready for production use

3. Include checks for:
   - Import statements work correctly
   - Configuration validation works
   - Both providers can be instantiated
   - Error handling works as expected
   - Statistics tracking works correctly

This script should give confidence that the implementation is complete and correct.
```

### Prompt 14.2: Create Rollback Plan

```
I need a rollback plan in case issues are discovered after deployment.

Requirements:
1. Document which files were changed and how to revert them
2. Create a rollback script that can quickly restore the previous functionality
3. Document the steps to validate that rollback was successful
4. Include instructions for preserving any new configuration while rolling back code changes

The rollback plan should ensure that users can quickly return to a working state if needed.
```
---
