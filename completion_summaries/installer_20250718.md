I have successfully orchestrated the step-by-step implementation of the plan to make the Work Journal application an installable executable. All coding and configuration tasks have been delegated and completed.

Here is a summary of the accomplished work:
*   **Dependencies Added**: [`requirements.txt`](requirements.txt:1) has been updated with `pyinstaller`, `waitress`, and `appdirs`.
*   **Server-Switching Logic**: A [`server_runner.py`](server_runner.py:1) module was created to switch between `uvicorn` for development and `waitress` for the bundled application. The main entry point has been updated to use this.
*   **Dynamic Asset Paths**: A `resource_path` helper function was created in [`web/resource_utils.py`](web/resource_utils.py:1) and integrated into [`web/app.py`](web/app.py:1) to ensure assets are found in both development and bundled modes.
*   **User Data Storage**: The application now stores the user's database in the standard OS-specific application data directory, managed by code in [`web/resource_utils.py`](web/resource_utils.py:1) and [`web/database.py`](web/database.py:1).
*   **Startup Logging**: File-based logging has been configured to aid in debugging user issues.
*   **PyInstaller Configuration**: A [`WorkJournalMaker.spec`](WorkJournalMaker.spec:1) file has been created with the complete configuration for building the single-file executable.
*   **Build and Test Plan**: A manual testing plan has been created at [`BUILD_AND_TEST.md`](BUILD_AND_TEST.md:1) to guide the final build and verification process.

The project is now fully prepared. You can proceed with the instructions in [`BUILD_AND_TEST.md`](BUILD_AND_TEST.md:1) to build the executable and perform functional testing.
