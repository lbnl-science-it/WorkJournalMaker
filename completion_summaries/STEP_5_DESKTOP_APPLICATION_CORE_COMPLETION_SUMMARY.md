## üîß Technical Architecture

### Component Integration Flow
```
DesktopApp
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Port Detector (functions) ‚Üí Find available port
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Server Manager ‚Üí Start/stop uvicorn server
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Browser Controller ‚Üí Launch browser
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ App Logger ‚Üí Structured logging
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ HTTP Client ‚Üí Health checking
```

### Startup Sequence
1. **Port Discovery**: Scan port range (8000-8099 default) for available port
2. **Server Launch**: Start uvicorn server on discovered port
3. **Health Check**: Wait for server readiness with HTTP polling
4. **Browser Launch**: Open browser to server URL (if enabled)
5. **State Tracking**: Mark application as running with current port

### Shutdown Sequence
1. **Server Stop**: Gracefully stop uvicorn server
2. **Status Verification**: Confirm server has stopped
3. **State Reset**: Clear current port and running status
4. **Cleanup**: Release resources and log completion
