 🎉 Implementation Complete!

  Perfect! All 21 tests pass for the FileDiscovery WorkWeek integration. Here's
   a comprehensive summary of what was successfully implemented:

  ✅ Prompt 8: File Discovery System Updates - COMPLETED

  📋 Implementation Summary

  🔧 Core Enhancements

  1. WorkWeekService Integration: FileDiscovery now uses
  WorkWeekService.calculate_week_ending_date() as the primary method for
  intelligent work week calculations
  2. Dual-Method Architecture:
    - Primary: Work week calculations with configurable schedules
    - Fallback: Legacy directory scanning for backward compatibility
    - Ultimate Fallback: Simple Friday calculation if all else fails
  3. Mixed Directory Support: Seamlessly handles both old daily directories and
   new weekly directories during transition
  4. Enhanced Error Handling: Graceful degradation with comprehensive logging

  🚀 Key Features Added

  - Factory Methods: create_with_work_week_service() and create_legacy_mode()
  - Status Monitoring: get_integration_status() and is_work_week_enabled()
  - Dynamic Configuration: set_work_week_service() for runtime updates
  - Async Safety: Proper handling of async WorkWeekService in sync context
  - Weekend Assignment: Saturday → previous week, Sunday → next week
  - Configurable Work Weeks: Monday-Friday, Sunday-Thursday, Custom schedules

  📊 Test Coverage

  - 21 comprehensive tests covering all integration scenarios
  - Mixed directory structure handling tested
  - Error handling and graceful degradation verified
  - Performance considerations validated
  - Backward compatibility maintained
  - Different work week configurations tested
  - Weekend assignment logic verified

  🔄 Backward Compatibility

  - All existing FileDiscovery API methods preserved
  - Added _calculate_week_ending() compatibility method for legacy tests
  - Legacy directory structures continue to work unchanged
  - No breaking changes to existing functionality

  ⚡ Performance & Reliability

  - Minimal overhead when WorkWeekService unavailable (<100ms for 10
  calculations)
  - Robust async handling with thread pool fallback
  - Comprehensive error handling with multiple fallback layers
  - Enhanced directory filtering for accurate file discovery

  🔍 Integration Points Ready

  The updated FileDiscovery is now ready to integrate with:
  - EntryManager (will use enhanced _construct_file_path method)
  - Web Interface (work week-aware file discovery)
  - CLI Tools (maintains full backward compatibility)
  - Database Sync (updated missing file path construction)

  📈 Behavioral Improvements

  The implementation successfully addresses the core issue from the blueprint:
  - Before: Each journal entry created its own daily directory (fragmented
  storage)
  - After: Entries are properly grouped into weekly directories based on work
  week configuration
  - Example: Monday 2024-04-15 now correctly maps to Friday 2024-04-19 week
  ending directory

  This completes Step 8 of the Work Week Directory Organization Implementation
  Blueprint with full backward compatibility and comprehensive test coverage!
