# Prompt 2: Work Week Calculation Logic - Completion Summary

**Date**: January 7, 2025  
**Blueprint Reference**: Work Week Directory Organization Implementation Blueprint - Prompt 2  
**Implementation Status**: ✅ **COMPLETED**

## Overview

Successfully implemented and enhanced the core work week calculation algorithm in the WorkWeekService class. The implementation provides robust, timezone-aware work week calculations with intelligent weekend handling for proper journal entry directory organization.

## Implementation Details

### Core Algorithm Implementation ✅

**File**: `web/services/work_week_service.py`

The work week calculation logic was already comprehensively implemented with the following key methods:

#### 1. Main Entry Point
- **`calculate_week_ending_date(entry_date, user_id)`** (lines 374-414)
  - Handles both `date` and `datetime` inputs
  - Timezone-aware calculations using existing timezone utilities
  - Comprehensive error handling with fallback mechanisms
  - Returns the appropriate week ending date for directory organization

#### 2. Core Calculation Logic
- **`_calculate_week_ending_for_date(entry_date, config)`** (lines 416-436)
  - Determines if entry falls within work week or weekend
  - Routes to appropriate calculation method
  - Supports all work week configurations

#### 3. Work Week Detection
- **`_is_within_work_week(entry_day, start_day, end_day)`** (lines 438-455)
  - Handles normal work weeks (e.g., Monday-Friday)
  - Supports work weeks spanning weekends (e.g., Friday-Thursday)
  - Robust logic for all day combinations

#### 4. Work Week End Calculation
- **`_find_work_week_end(entry_date, start_day, end_day)`** (lines 457-483)
  - Calculates end date for entries within work week
  - Handles both normal and spanning weekend configurations
  - Precise date arithmetic for all scenarios

#### 5. Weekend Assignment Logic ✅
- **`_assign_weekend_to_work_week(entry_date, start_day, end_day)`** (lines 485-512)
  - **Saturday entries** → assigned to **previous work week**
  - **Sunday entries** → assigned to **next work week**
  - Implements the specified weekend handling requirements

#### 6. Supporting Methods
- **`_find_previous_work_week_end()`** (lines 514-527)
- **`_find_next_work_week_end()`** (lines 529-542)
- **`_calculate_simple_friday_week_ending()`** (lines 544-560) - Fallback method

### Edge Case Handling ✅

The implementation robustly handles all specified edge cases:

1. **Year Boundaries**
   - New Year's Eve/Day calculations across year transitions
   - Proper week assignment for year-end scenarios

2. **Leap Years**
   - Correct handling of February 29th
   - Proper date arithmetic in leap years

3. **Timezone Transitions**
   - Uses existing timezone utilities for conversions
   - Handles daylight saving time transitions
   - Timezone-aware date calculations

4. **Work Week Configurations**
   - Monday-Friday (standard business week)
   - Sunday-Thursday (alternative business week)
   - Custom configurations with any start/end day combination
   - Work weeks spanning weekends

## Comprehensive Test Suite ✅

- Weekend assignment logic (Saturday → previous, Sunday → next)
- DateTime and date input handling
- Error fallback mechanisms

#### 4. Preview and Display (2 tests)
- Work week configuration preview generation
- Human-readable description formatting

#### 5. Edge Cases and Boundary Conditions (6 tests)
- **Year boundary scenarios** - New Year transitions
- **Leap year scenarios** - February 29th handling
- **Complex spanning configurations** - Friday-Tuesday work weeks
- **Auto-correction logic** - Single-day work week fixes
- **Timezone boundary calculations** - UTC/local time conversions
- **Extreme configurations** - 6-day work weeks, validation limits

#### 6. Service Maintenance (4 tests)
- Health status reporting
- Configuration caching functionality
- Database validation and repair
- Service reliability features

### Test Execution Results
```bash
$ pyenv activate WorkJournal && python -m pytest tests/test_work_week_service.py -v
============================== 38 passed in 0.23s ==============================
```

## Algorithm Verification

### Weekend Assignment Logic ✅
Verified the core weekend assignment requirements:

```python
# Saturday entries → Previous work week
saturday = date(2025, 1, 11)  # Saturday
result = calculate_week_ending_date(saturday)  # Returns 2025-01-10 (Previous Friday)

# Sunday entries → Next work week  
sunday = date(2025, 1, 12)    # Sunday
result = calculate_week_ending_date(sunday)    # Returns 2025-01-17 (Next Friday)
```

### Configuration Support ✅
All specified work week configurations are supported:

1. **Monday-Friday** (1-5): Standard business week
2. **Sunday-Thursday** (7-4): Alternative business week  
3. **Custom configurations**: Any valid start/end day combination
4. **Spanning configurations**: Work weeks that cross weekends
