# WorkJournalMaker - Project History and Completion Status

## Project Timeline

The WorkJournalMaker project has evolved from a CLI-based tool to a full-fledged web application. The development process has been divided into several phases, with a focus on integrating the new web layer with the existing CLI components.

## Implementation Phases

The implementation was broken down into 18 distinct steps, organized into the following phases:

- **Phase 1: Foundation Setup (Steps 1-3):** Focused on setting up the web directory structure, database schema, and core FastAPI application.
- **Phase 2: Entry Management Integration (Steps 4-6):** Integrated the existing `FileDiscovery` system with the new web layer through the `EntryManager` service.
- **Phase 3: Calendar Integration (Steps 7-8):** Added calendar functionality to the web interface, allowing for date-based navigation and entry queries.
- **Phase 4: Web Summarization (Steps 9-10):** Integrated the AI-powered summarization pipeline with the web interface, including progress tracking and async operations.
- **Phase 5: Base Web Interface (Steps 11-13):** Developed the foundational HTML templates, CSS styling, and core UI components.
- **Phase 6: Advanced Features (Steps 14-16):** Implemented advanced features such as the interactive calendar view, settings management, and summarization interface.
- **Phase 7: Testing & Deployment (Steps 17-18):** Focused on comprehensive testing, including integration, API, and UI testing, as well as production deployment.

## Completion Status

The project is considered functionally complete, with all 18 implementation steps having been successfully executed. The application is now in a stable state, with both the web and CLI interfaces providing a comprehensive set of features for managing work journals.
