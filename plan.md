# FastAPI Desktop Application Packaging - TDD Implementation Plan

## Project Overview

This plan outlines a test-driven development approach to package the WorkJournalMaker FastAPI application into cross-platform desktop executables for Windows and macOS using PyInstaller and automated GitHub Actions builds.

## TDD Implementation Strategy

Each step follows strict TDD principles:
1. **Red**: Write failing tests first
2. **Green**: Write minimal code to pass tests
3. **Refactor**: Improve code while keeping tests passing
4. **Integration**: Wire components together with integration tests
